# MTA Project
#### by Brian K, Chris G, Jeremy B, and Laura C

Our goal was to recommend times and locations to place WomenTechWomenYesâ€™s street teams.  Street teams will be placed at MTA subway stations to maximize attendance and contributions to WTWY summer gala.

We analyzed traffic volume and local income data.  We also examined proximity to large, local technology companies to balance maximizing attendance versus maximizing contributions. By incorporating IRS income data by ZIP code, our goal will be to identify a set of subway stations and days of the week for WTWY to optimize the placement of their street teams for collecting signatures.

## Project Setup

#### Installations

Install basemap - instructions here: https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html

If you're missing some of the libraries in the scripts, you may need to use _pip install_ or a similar method. 

#### Data Sources
